# file-management-sys-using-XX-hash

 The File Management System project allows users to identify and manage duplicate files within a specified directory. It accomplishes this through a well-defined file access mechanism, ensuring that it navigates the directory, accesses files, and prepares them for further analysis in a responsible and user-friendly manner.


(a)	Directory Selection.

(i)	The process begins with the user's interaction with the graphical user interface (GUI). The program's user-friendly interface, powered by the Tkinter library, enables users to select a directory for scanning. This initial step is crucial, as it puts the user in control of the entire process. 

(ii)	By selecting a specific directory, the user indicates their intent to scan the contents of that directory and its subdirectories. 

(iii)	The directory selection mechanism adheres to ethical considerations by requiring explicit user consent before any file access or scanning takes place.

(iv)	Upon choosing a directory, the selected directory's path is passed as input to the program. This action is simple and straightforward, making the tool accessible to a wide range of users.


(b)	File Scanning.

(i)	File scanning is the core functionality. It allows the program to systematically explore the contents of the selected directory and its subdirectories. To perform this task, the program leverages the `os.walk` function, a powerful feature of the Python standard library.


(c)	Recursion and Subdirectory Traversal.

(i)	The `os.walk` function facilitates recursive traversal of a directory tree. This means that the program not only scans the files in the selected directory but also delves into its subdirectories. As it traverses deeper into the directory tree, it uncovers additional files and subdirectories. This recursive approach ensures that no file remains unexamined, making the tool thorough in its scanning process.


(d)	Gathering File Information.

(i)	During the scanning process, the program collects essential information about each file it encounters. This information includes the file's path, extension, and size. 

(ii)	The collected data is then used for further processing, such as filtering files based on specific criteria and, most importantly, for calculating file hashes.


(e)	File Filtering.

(i)	File filtering is a pivotal step in the file access mechanism of the File Management System. 

(ii)	This step helps streamline the scanning process by narrowing down the list of files that need to be examined. It's essential for optimizing the tool's performance and user experience.


(f)	Selecting File Types.

(i)	Users have the option to specify particular file types they are interested in or to use predefined default categories. The tool categorizes files into types like PDF, text, image, audio, video, and executables (mostly found duplicates). 

(ii)	The user can selectively include or exclude these categories from the scanning process. By enabling this level of customization, the program respects the user's preferences and reduces unnecessary data processing.


(g)	Exclusion of Unnecessary Files/.

(i)	In addition to filtering by file types, the File Management System excludes specific file extensions listed in the `excluded_extensions` list. This list typically contains file types and directories associated with system files, configurations, or files that are not relevant to the task of identifying duplicate files. 

(ii)	By omitting these files from the scan, the tool minimizes the risk of unintentionally affecting system or important files, adding an extra layer of safety to the process.


(h)	File Size Criteria

(i)	Another dimension of file filtering provided by the File Management System is the ability to consider file size as a criterion for inclusion or exclusion. Users can specify their preference for file size, categorizing files as small, medium, or large. This size categorization is based on a configurable threshold. Files are categorized into one of these size groups to provide users with flexibility and control over the scanning process.

(ii)	The determination of file size is achieved through the `os.path.getsize` function. This function retrieves the size of each file in bytes. By evaluating the file size, users can focus their attention on specific file sizes that are relevant to their needs. This feature is especially beneficial when users have limited storage space and want to free up room by identifying and managing large files.

(iii)	The file size criterion is an ethical consideration as it respects the user's intent and the practicality of the task. By enabling users to filter files based on size, the tool ensures that users are not overwhelmed by large files or distracted by small ones that may not be of concern.



Hashing Mechanism

The File Management System's hashing mechanism is the core of its ability to identify duplicate files efficiently and accurately. Hashing involves the conversion of file data into a fixed-size string of characters, which serves as a unique "fingerprint" for the file. The project relies on the XX Hash algorithm, specifically xxh3_64, for this purpose.


Hash Calculation

The process of hash calculation is a fundamental operation in the File Management System. This operation allows the program to create a unique hash for each file, which can then be used for comparison with other files.

(a)	Initialization: The process begins by initializing the hash function with an initial state or seed value. This seed value can be set to a constant or generated randomly. The seed value helps ensure the uniqueness of hash values and is crucial in scenarios where security is a concern.

(b)	Dividing Input Data into Blocks The input data, in this case, a file, is divided into manageable blocks. The default block size is often set to 65536 bytes, but it can be adjusted based on the specific use case and performance requirements.


(c)	Processing Blocks: XX Hash processes each block of data sequentially. For each block, the following steps are performed:

(i)	Initialization of Accumulator Variables Several accumulator variables, referred to as "registers," are set to initial values. These registers play a significant role in the mixing and transformation of the data.

(ii)	Mixing and Transformation: The data within the block is processed through a series of mixing and transformation operations. This step involves bitwise operations, shifts, and other operations to create a well-distributed and unique hash value for the block.

(iii)	Updating Accumulator Variables: As the mixing and transformation operations are executed, the accumulator variables are continuously updated to incorporate the processed data.


(d)	Combining Blocks: As each block is processed, the resulting hash value for that block is combined with the hash value from the previous block. This combination ensures that the hash value represents the entire file's content and is not limited to individual blocks.


(e)	Finalization: After all blocks are processed, the final hash value is obtained by applying additional mixing and transformation operations to the combined hash value. This step further enhances the uniqueness and quality of the resulting hash.


(f)	Optional Seed Incorporation: If a seed value was used to initialize the hash function, it is applied as a final step in the calculation. This step ensures that the hash value is influenced by the seed, making it a unique fingerprint for the input data.


(g)	Hash Value Output: The final hash value, often represented as a 64-bit or 128-bit integer, is produced as the result of the calculation. This hash value is the unique fingerprint of the input data and is used for various purposes, such as duplicate file detection in the File Management System.


(h)	Block-Based Hashing.	Hash calculation occurs in a block-based fashion. The program reads files in manageable blocks, with each block having a default size of 65536 bytes. This approach has several advantages:


(j)	Memory Efficiency. By processing files in blocks, the tool conserves memory resources. It does not need to load entire files into memory, making it efficient for scanning large files.


(k)	Progressive Calculation: Hash calculation is incremental, meaning that the hash value is updated as each block is processed. This incremental approach enhances the program's performance and allows it to work seamlessly with files of varying sizes.


(l)	Data Integrity The block-based hashing mechanism ensures data integrity. Even in the event of file corruption or interruptions, the program can still generate accurate hashes for the processed blocks.


Hashing For Duplicate Detection

The primary purpose of hashing within the File Management System is to detect duplicate files. Once the program has calculated the hash for each file, it keeps track of these hash values. If two or more files have the same hash value, they are identified as potential duplicates.


Efficient Duplicate Detection

The use of hashing for duplicate detection is a highly efficient technique. It significantly reduces the computational effort required to compare files. Instead of performing byte-by-byte comparisons of file contents, the program simply compares the hash values. This approach is particularly advantageous when dealing with a large number of files, as it accelerates the identification process.


 False Positives Mitigation

It's important to note that hash collisions can occur, where two different files produce the same hash value. However, xx Hash is designed to have a very low probability of collisions, making it highly reliable for duplicate detection. In the rare event of a hash collision, the tool employs additional checks to verify the files' contents, reducing the possibility of false positives.

Ensuring Data Privacy and Security

 From an ethical standpoint, the hashing mechanism used by the File Management System ensures data privacy and security. The program does not access the content of the files in a manner that compromises user data. Instead, it operates in a read-only fashion, calculating hashes for file identification without modifying or reading the actual file content. This design choice aligns with ethical considerations surrounding data privacy.


 The hashing mechanism also serves as a privacy-preserving technique, as it does not expose sensitive or personal data contained within files. It also guarantees that the tool does not inadvertently reveal the content of files during the scanning process.

User Experience and UI Design.
49.	User-Centric UI Elements.
(a)	Button Design. Buttons are meticulously designed to align with user expectations and actions. For example, the "Select Directory" button is strategically placed at the top, following a common user flow. Its label explicitly states the action to be taken, making it instantly recognizable. Users appreciate the clarity of purpose, as it minimizes cognitive load and decision-making.
(b)	Checkbox Organization. The categorization of file types through checkboxes is an ergonomic design choice. It allows users to navigate and select file categories efficiently. The checkboxes are intuitively grouped under headings like "PDF," "Text," and "Image," mirroring users' mental models. This organization enhances the efficiency of file selection and empowers users to customize their scan to specific file categories, streamlining the process of identifying duplicates.
(c)	Size Criteria Customization. The inclusion of size criteria checkboxes caters to users who consider file size a vital parameter when searching for duplicates. Users can easily specify whether they want to include "Small," "Medium," or "Large" files in their scan. This customization ensures that the software adapts to users' specific needs, making it a more user-centric tool.
(d)	Grouping & Displaying Duplicate Files by Hash. The results are intelligently organized and presented to users, simplifying the process of identifying and managing duplicate files. The software groups duplicate files by their unique hash values. This grouping serves several purposes:
(i)	Efficient Identification. By grouping files with the same hash, users can quickly identify clusters of duplicate files. Each group represents potential duplicates, making it easier to decide which files to keep and which to delete.
(ii)	Clarity and Order. The grouping ensures that results are presented in a clear and orderly fashion. Users don't have to sift through an unstructured list of files but can review duplicates systematically.
(iii)	Reduction in Visual Clutter. Grouping files by hash significantly reduces visual clutter. Users aren't overwhelmed by a long list of files; instead, they see a concise summary of duplicate clusters.

 User-Friendly Preview and Deletion Options:
(a)	Preview Button. For each file within a duplicate group, the software provides a "Preview" button. This feature enables users to open and preview a file before deciding whether to keep or delete it. The preview option offers users a quick and efficient way to assess the file's content and relevance, enhancing the decision-making process.
(b)	Delete Button: In addition to preview, a "Delete" button is available for each file. Users can easily remove unwanted duplicates with a simple click. This streamlined deletion process eliminates the need for navigating to the file's location in the file explorer and manually deleting it. It offers users a sense of control over file management.
(c)	Time-Saving.  The software's design not only reduces cognitive load but also saves time. Users don't have to switch between different applications to preview and delete files, making the process more efficient.

Real-time Feedback.
(a)	Visual Progress.  The progress bar is a critical functional element. It's a visual representation of the software's ongoing operation. As users initiate the scan, the progress bar visually fills, showing the percentage of completion. This not only keeps users informed but also offers a sense of progress. It aligns with the well-established psychological concept that users prefer feedback and acknowledgment of their actions.
(b)	Scan Statistics for Decision-Making.   Post-scan statistics empower users to make informed decisions about their next steps. The details of total files scanned and the number of duplicate files found will give detailed state of the users in terms of best practices followed and data integrity of the directory scanned
